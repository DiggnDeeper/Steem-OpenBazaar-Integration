# This is a draft for the Steem post on the special account @steemonob, which is used strictly for this project. 

#### Repository
My GitHub account/ repo for this project: https://github.com/DiggnDeeper/Steem-OpenBazaar-Integration

#### Details
- <b>What is OpenBazaar?</b>
[OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/) is an open source, peer-to-peer platform for trading physical goods, services and crypto-currencies. There are no fees for using the software, listing, buying, or selling. It is easy to use and fully featured with inventory and listing management, product variants and more. The platform has an excellent escrow system for conflict resolution. 

- <b>Benefits of Steem/ SBD integration on OpenBazaar:</b>
Steem/ SBD integration would be a big asset for both communities. It would provide more liquidity to the Steem eco-system and exposure of the excellent qualities of our blockchain. At the time of writing, the OpenBazaar community estimates at least 150 thousand nodes are running. Numbers are hard to come by on the platform by design, but however you look at it, that is a lot. We could all benefit by the faster transaction of Steem and the exposure on OpenBazaar.

- <b>Posts on @DiggnDeeper.com that started the project:</b>
    -[Project Advice Needed: Is Using Alt Accounts A Good Idea?](https://busy.org/@diggndeeper.com/project-advice-needed-is-using-alt-accounts-a-good-idea) I decided to create a special account, @steemonob to help fund, promote, post to @utopian-io and update interested parties and donors. 
    -[previous call for developers](https://busy.org/@diggndeeper.com/dev-wanted-for-openbazaar-integration) @swapsteem stepped in to help get things underway.

We are looking to find a developer who would detail the requirements for integration of Steem and SBD into the OpenBazaar platform.  

The task begins with a review of the documentation within [https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go) to see if there are any obvious gaps in their coin's ability to meet this interface. You can get in touch with OpenBazaar with questions to properly understand the scope of this work from their perspective.

#### Components

Our current task involves
1. Review the open source code and documentation (link provided above) and provide a feasibility report.
2. Determine the technology stack required to build the plugin.
3. Create a feature list and roadmap.
4. Create tasks in Github project board for easy tracking of progress.
5. Create a report detailing your findings on these issues. 

#### Deadline
I don't have a deadline determined and I don't know how to specify one because I am looking for a knowledgable opinion about the scope of the project.

There will be a bounty of at least 50 Steem. I would like to see that increase to 100 steem shortly. I will be doing a campain round to pick up some donors and delegators to fund this task and more.
