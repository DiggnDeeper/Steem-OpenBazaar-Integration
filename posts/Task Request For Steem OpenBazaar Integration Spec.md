# This is a draft for the Steem post on the special account @steemonob, which is used strictly for this project. 

#### Repository
My GitHub account/ repo for this project: https://github.com/DiggnDeeper/Steem-OpenBazaar-Integration

#### Details
- What is OpenBazaar?
OpenBazaar is an open source, decentralized platform for trading physical goods, services and crypto-currencies. The platform has an excellent escrow system for conflict resolution. 

- Why we need Steem ob integration-
Steem/ SBD integration would be a big asset for both communities. 

[previous call for developers](https://busy.org/@diggndeeper.com/dev-wanted-for-openbazaar-integration)

- benefits to steem users and ecosystem
Provide more liquidity to the Steem eco-system and exposure of the excellent qualities of our blockchain.

I would like to find a developer who would detail the requirements for integration of Steem and SBD into the OpenBazaar platform and possibly perform the necessary changes. 

The task begins with a review of the documentation within [https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go) to see if there are any obvious gaps in their coin's ability to meet this interface. You can get in touch with OpenBazaar with questions to properly understand the scope of this work from their perspective.

#### Components

Divide into small tasks like
1. Review the open source code and documentation and provide a feasibility report.
2. Determine the technology stack required to build the plugin.
3. Create a feature list and roadmap.
4. Create tasks in Github project board for easy tracking of progress.

#### Deadline
I don't have a deadline determined and I don't know how to specify one because I am looking for a knowledgable opinion about the scope of the project.
