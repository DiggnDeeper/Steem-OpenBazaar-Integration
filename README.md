# Steem-OpenBazaar-Integration
This is an attempt to find developers to integrate Steem and SBD into OpenBazaar. Sadly, I am not a developer, but I will be using Utopian.io to attempt this task. 

The goal is to get Steem/ SBD integration with OpenBazaar. I would also like to see SwapSteem market integration so that people can buy and sell Steem/ SBD. This would be excellent for the Steem community and I believe for OpenBazaar also, since Steem is one of, if not the best performing blockchain available and also has a great community behind it. 

I am currently working on Utopian.io submission per their specs using the dedicated account @steemonob.
